text,"In this lesson, I'm going to walk you through a one sample t-test step-by-step using the 'mtcars' dataset. This dataset comes built in to R and gives a series of design and performance characteristics for 32 car models built in 1973-74.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Once you learn the one sample t-test procedure, I will have you complete a second t-test analysis on your own using the same dataset. If you get stuck, there will be hints along the way.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,Recall that we must use a t-test instead of a z-test when we don't have access to a population variance (or population standard deviation) and thus must estimate it from the data.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,Let's begin by taking a look at the 'mtcars' dataset. Type 'mtcars' without quotes and press Enter.,NA,mtcars,swirl1cmd=mtcars,Type 'mtcars' without quotes and press Enter.,NA,NA,NA
text,"We are interested in determining whether there is a significant difference  between the average fuel efficiency for cars in our dataset, which were built in 1973-74, and the average fuel efficiency for all motor vehicles in 1974. According to a recent report by the US Energy Information Administration, the average fuel efficiency for all motor vehicles in 1974 was 12.0 miles per gallon (mpg). You can view the report here: http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec1_17.pdf",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Our null hypothesis (H0) is that the average fuel efficiency of the cars in our dataset is NOT significantly different from 12.0 mpg. Our alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average fuel efficiency of the cars in our dataset IS significantly different from 12.0 mpg. In order to either accept or reject the null hypthesis, we must compute our t-statistic and compare it to the appropriate t critical value.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"Since we are mainly concerned with the 'mpg' variable, let's extract the entire 'mpg' column from the dataset and store it in a new variable called 'allMPG'. Do this now by typing 'allMPG <- mtcars$mpg' and pressing Enter.",NA,allMPG <- mtcars$mpg,swirl1cmd=allMPG <- mtcars$mpg,Type 'allMPG <- mtcars$mpg' without quotes and press Enter.,NA,NA,NA
text,"If you are new to R, the '<-' is called an assignment operator and is just a 'less than' sign followed by a dash, with no space in between. It is customary that you include a space before and after the assignment operator. You can think of the assignment operator as an 'equals' sign since it just assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Also, the '$' in between 'mtcars' and 'mpg' says that we want to access the 'mpg' column from the 'mtcars' dataset. By storing our 'mpg' data in the 'allMPG' variable, we can now avoid using this '$' notation repeatedly.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,Let's take a look at what's stored in 'allMPG'. Typing a variable's name and pressing Enter will print its contents to the console.,NA,allMPG,swirl1cmd=allMPG,Type 'allMPG' and press Enter.,NA,NA,NA
text,"Recall that computing a t-statistic requires 4 important values: sample mean, assumed population mean, variance, and sample size.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"Our first step is to compute the mean value for the 'mpg' data, which is conveniently stored in our newly created 'allMPG' variable. In R, the 'mean' function computes the mean of a variable for us. The notation is 'mean(variableName)'. Try it now on the 'allMPG' variable.",NA,mean(allMPG),swirl1cmd=mean(allMPG),Type 'mean(allMPG)' to compute the mean of the 'allMPG' variable,NA,NA,NA
text,"To make future calculations simpler, we should store this mean in a new variable, which we will call 'sampMeanMPG'. This variable name stands for 'sample mean of the mpg variable'. It's always good to be descriptive when choosing variable names, so that you don't get confused later on.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"Using the assignment operator, assign the value 'mean(allMPG)' to the variable 'sampMeanMPG' now.",NA,sampMeanMPG <- mean(allMPG),swirl1cmd=sampMeanMPG <- mean(allMPG),Type 'sampMeanMPG <- mean(allMPG)' to assign the mean of 'allMPG' to the variable 'sampMeanMPG'.,NA,NA,NA
text,"The next value that we need for our t-statistic is the assumed population mean, which is in this case is given to be 12.0 miles per gallon by the report referenced earlier.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,The next quantity that we need for computing our t-statistic is the sample variance. The function for computing variance in R is 'var' and is used in the same way as the 'mean' function. Try assigning the variance of 'allMPG' to a new variable called 'sampVarMPG'.,NA,sampVarMPG <- var(allMPG),swirl1cmd=sampVarMPG <- var(allMPG),Type 'sampVarMPG <- var(allMPG)' to assign the variance of 'allMPG' to the variable 'sampVarMPG'.,NA,NA,NA
text,"The last quantity needed for our t-statistic calculation is the sample size of our dataset, or in other words, the number of car models on which we have data. The easiest method of computing this is to find the number of elements contained in our 'allMPG' variable. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,This is found using the 'length' function. The syntax is similar to the other functions you've already used. Compute the sample size now using the 'length' function and store the result to the variable 'n'.,NA,n <- length(allMPG),swirl1cmd=n <- length(allMPG),Type 'n <- length(allMPG)' to store the sample size to the variable 'n'.,NA,NA,NA
text,"Recall that a t-statistic is computed by subtracting the population mean from the sample mean and dividing that quantity by the square root of the sample variance over n. This is difficult to express in words, but very easy to compute.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,Store the following quantity in a new variable called 'tStat': '(sampMeanMPG - 12.0) / sqrt(sampVarMPG/n)'.,NA,tStat <- (sampMeanMPG - 12.0) / sqrt(sampVarMPG/n),swirl1cmd=tStat <- (sampMeanMPG - 12.0) / sqrt(sampVarMPG/n),Type 'tStat <- (sampMeanMPG - 12.0) / sqrt(sampVarMPG/n)' to store the value of our t-statistic in a new variable called 'tStat'.,NA,NA,NA
text,"Now that we have our t-statistic, we must compare it to our t critical value. In order to do this, we need to specify the t distribution corresponding to the correct degrees of freedom (which equals n - 1).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,Compute the degrees of freedom by storing the value 'n - 1' in a new variable called 'myDF'.,NA,myDF <- n - 1,swirl1cmd=myDF <- n - 1,Type 'myDF <- n - 1'.,NA,NA,NA
text,"Before moving on to our final calculations, let's view the contents of the variables involved. Remember that typing a variable's name and pressing Enter will show you the contents of that variable.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

text,"Remember that a p-value gives us the probability of getting a t-statistic as or more extreme than the one we actually got from the data. Therefore, since we have a positive t-statistic here, we want to first find the area under the t-distribution curve to the right of the value of our t-statistic. Then, since the t-distribution is symmetrical about 0, we can multiply this value by 2 to get the p-value for a two-sided test.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Let's compute the area under the curve to the right of our t-statistic using R's 'pt' function. In case you're wondering, the 'p' in 'pt' stands for 'probability' and the 't' stands for 't-distribution'.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"Type the following to compute the probability of getting a t-statistic that's greater than the value of the one we got: 'pVal1 <- pt(tStat, df = myDF, lower.tail=FALSE)'",NA,"pVal1 <- pt(tStat, df = myDF, lower.tail=FALSE)","swirl1cmd=pVal1 <- pt(tStat, df = myDF, lower.tail=FALSE)","Type 'pVal1 <- pt(tStat, df = myDF, lower.tail=FALSE)' and press Enter.",NA,NA,NA
text,"To reiterate, the variable 'pVal1' now stores the probability of getting a t-statistic greater than or equal to the one we got. However, since we are interested in both extremes (i.e. a two-sided test), we must multiply this probability by 2 to get our official p-value!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,Let's do this now. We will assign the new probability to the 'pVal' variable. This can be done by typing the following: 'pVal <- pVal1 * 2.',NA,pVal <- pVal1 * 2,swirl1cmd=pVal <- pVal1 * 2,Type 'pVal <- pVal1 * 2',NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,Let's look at the the value of our p-value. Type 'pVal' and press Enter.,NA,pVal,swirl1cmd=pVal,Type 'pVal' and press Enter.,NA,NA,NA
text,"Since our p-value is well below 0.05 (the most commonly used significance level), we can safely reject our null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the fuel efficiency of the cars included in our dataset and the assumed population average fuel efficiency stated in the EIA report.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"The most likely explanation for this difference is that the EIA number includes both small and large vehicles, whereas our dataset consists of mainly smaller vehicles. It is a well known fact that lower vehicle weight is typically associated with increased fuel efficiency.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"It took us quite a few steps to arrive at this conclusion. Fortunately, R has a built-in function for computing t-test p-values. The name of the function is 't.test' and upon specifying the data of interest, the assumed population mean, and whether the test is one-sided or two-sided, it will give you the desired p-value.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"Let's try it now and see if the resulting p-value is the same as the one you calculated above.

Make sure to put double quotes around the 'alternative'.",NA,NA,NA
text,"Success!!! Your p-values are equal! In the future, using the 't.test' function will save you time and reduce your chances of making a computational error. However, it's important for you to understand the calculations behind the t-test procedure, so that you properly interpret the results.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
