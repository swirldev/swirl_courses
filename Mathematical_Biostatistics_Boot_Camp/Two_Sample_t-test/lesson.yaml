- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you are going to complete a two sample t-test step-by-step
    using the 'mtcars' dataset. This dataset comes built in to R and gives a series
    of design and performance characteristics for 32 car models built in 1973-74.

- Class: text
  Output: We are interested in determining whether there is a significant difference
    between the average fuel efficiency for cars with automatic and manual transmissions.
    In this dataset, miles per gallon is given by the 'mpg' variable and transmission
    type is given by the 'am' variable (0 = automatic, 1 = manual).

- Class: text
  Output: 'Therefore, our null hypothesis (H0) is that the average fuel efficiency
    is the same for cars with automatic and manual transmissions. In other words,
    the difference between the average mpg values for cars with automatic and manual
    transmissions is not statistically significantly different from zero. '

- Class: text
  Output: Our alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a statistically significant
    difference in miles per gallon between cars with automatic and manual transmissions
    and therefore the difference does not equal zero. In order to either accept or
    reject the null hypothesis, we must compute our t-statistic and compare it to
    the appropriate t critical value.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Since we are interested in comparing the average mpg of cars with different
    transmission types, let''s separate the entire ''mtcars'' dataset into two smaller
    datasets: one containing the cars with automatic transmissions and one containing
    the cars with manual transmissions. '

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's begin by viewing the 'am' column from the dataset. For now, do NOT
    assign it to a new variable.
  CorrectAnswer: mtcars$am
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=mtcars$am
  Hint: Type 'mtcars$am' without quotes and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now, type the following in order to look at only the data for the cars
    with automatic transmissions and assign it to the variable ''auto'': ''auto <-
    mtcars[mtcars$am==0, ]'''
  CorrectAnswer: auto <- mtcars[mtcars$am==0, ]
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=auto <- mtcars[mtcars$am==0, ]
  Hint: Type 'auto <- mtcars[mtcars$am==0, ]' without quotes and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: As you can see above, in the first entry of the brackets, we specified which
    rows we are interested in. In this case, we wanted to extract the rows in which
    the transmission type equaled '0', representing automatic. In R, the boolean operator
    "==" is used as a comparison tool and extracts only the data for which the values
    on the left side of the "==" are equivalent to the values on the right side of
    the "==".

- Class: text
  Output: 'In the second entry of the brackets, we specified which columns we are
    interested in. In this case, we wanted to first extract all of the column information.
    Leaving the second entry blank signals to R that you would like all of the columns. '

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try performing this same procedure for cars with manual transmissions and
    assign it to the variable 'man'.
  CorrectAnswer: man <- mtcars[mtcars$am==1, ]
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=man <- mtcars[mtcars$am==1, ]
  Hint: Type 'man <- mtcars[mtcars$am==1, ]' without quotes and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now that we have broken our data into two distinct groups, we can condense
    our dataset even further by focusing only on the particular variable of interest.
    We are only interested in comparing the average mpg of cars with different transmission
    types, so use the syntax learned previously to extract the entire ''mpg'' column
    from our new dataset ''auto'' and store it in a new variable called ''autoMPG''. '
  CorrectAnswer: autoMPG <- auto$mpg
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=autoMPG <- auto$mpg
  Hint: 'Type ''autoMPG <- auto$mpg'' without quotes and press Enter. '

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Perform this command again but for cars with manual transmissions and store
    it in a new variable called 'manMPG'.
  CorrectAnswer: manMPG <- man$mpg
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=manMPG <- man$mpg
  Hint: Type 'manMPG <- man$mpg' without quotes and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: 'For the two-sample t-test, we need to compute 6 important values: the difference
    in sample means, the assumed difference in population means, the sample variance
    for each group, and the sample size for each group.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Our first step is to compute the mean value for the ''autoMPG'' data. Compute
    the mean and store it in a new variable called ''sampMeanAutoMPG''. '
  CorrectAnswer: sampMeanAutoMPG <- mean(autoMPG)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sampMeanAutoMPG <- mean(autoMPG)
  Hint: Type 'sampMeanAutoMPG <- mean(autoMPG)' to compute the mean of 'autoMPG' and
    store it in the variable 'sampMeanAutoMPG'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Also compute the mean value for the ''manMPG'' data and store it in a new
    variable called ''sampMeanManMPG''. '
  CorrectAnswer: sampMeanManMPG <- mean(manMPG)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sampMeanManMPG <- mean(manMPG)
  Hint: Type 'sampMeanManMPG <- mean(manMPG)' to compute the mean of 'manMPG' and
    store it in the variable 'sampMeanManMPG'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now, subtract the value contained in the variable ''sampMeanAutoMPG'' from
    the value contained in the variable ''sampMeanManMPG'' to find the difference
    in sample means and store it in a new variable called ''diffSampMean''. '
  CorrectAnswer: diffSampMean <- sampMeanManMPG - sampMeanAutoMPG
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=diffSampMean <- sampMeanManMPG - sampMeanAutoMPG
  Hint: Type 'diffSampMean <- sampMeanManMPG - sampMeanAutoMPG' to compute the difference
    in sample means and store it in a new variable called 'diffSampMean'.

- Class: text
  Output: You could also reverse the order and subtract 'sampMeanAutoMPG' from sampMeanManMPG'
    and you would still end up with the correct answer. However, in this example we
    will stick with the difference calculated the first way.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'We perform our t-test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is
    true, so the difference in population means is assumed to be zero. This is because
    the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference in fuel efficiency
    between cars with automatic and manual transmissions. Assign the value zero to
    a new variable called ''diffPopMean''. '
  CorrectAnswer: diffPopMean <- 0
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=diffPopMean <- 0
  Hint: Type 'diffPopMean <- 0' without quotes and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next, use the 'var' function to compute the variance of 'autoMPG' and store
    it in a new variable called 'sampVarAutoMPG'.
  CorrectAnswer: sampVarAutoMPG <- var(autoMPG)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sampVarAutoMPG <- var(autoMPG)
  Hint: Type 'sampVarAutoMPG <- var(autoMPG)' to compute the sample variance for the
    cars with automatic transmissions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, compute the variance for the cars with manual transmissions and store
    it in a new variable called 'sampVarManMPG'.
  CorrectAnswer: sampVarManMPG <- var(manMPG)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sampVarManMPG <- var(manMPG)
  Hint: Type 'sampVarManMPG <- var(manMPG)' to compute the sample variance for the
    cars with manual transmissions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The last two values we need are the sample sizes for each group. In order
    to calculate the number of cars with automatic transmissions, use the 'length'
    function on the variable 'autoMPG' and store the result in a new variable called
    'nAuto'. Try this now.
  CorrectAnswer: nAuto <- length(autoMPG)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=nAuto <- length(autoMPG)
  Hint: Type 'nAuto <- length(autoMPG)' to record the number of cars with automatic
    transmissions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the same 'length' function but on the cars with manual transmissions
    and store the result in a new variable called 'nMan'.
  CorrectAnswer: nMan <- length(manMPG)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=nMan <- length(manMPG)
  Hint: Type 'nMan <- length(manMPG)' to record the number of cars with manual transmissions.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Recall that the numerator for a two sample t-statistic is computed by subtracting
    the difference in assumed population means from the difference in sample means.
    The denominator is computed by taking the square root of the sum of the following
    two quantities: the variance for our group of cars with manual transmissions divided
    by the size of that group, and the variance for our group of cars with automatic
    transmissions divided by the size of that group. This is difficult to express
    in words, but very easy to compute.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using your knowledge of this equation, first try to compute the numerator
    of this t-statistic and store it in a new variable called 'numer'.
  CorrectAnswer: numer <- diffSampMean-diffPopMean
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=numer <- diffSampMean-diffPopMean
  Hint: Type 'numer <- diffSampMean-diffPopMean' to subtract the difference in assumed
    population means from the difference in sample means.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, try computing the denominator of this t-statistic and store it in a
    new variable called 'denom'.
  CorrectAnswer: |+
    denom <- sqrt(sampVarManMPG/nMan + sampVarAutoMPG/nAuto)

  AnswerTests: |+
    swirl1cmd=denom <- sqrt(sampVarManMPG/nMan + sampVarAutoMPG/nAuto)

  Hint: Type 'denom <- sqrt(sampVarManMPG/nMan + sampVarAutoMPG/nAuto)' to compute
    the denominator of the t-statistic.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since we have now computed both the numerator and the denominator of the
    t-statistic, perform the simple calculation needed to find the actual two sample
    t-statistic value and store this value in a new variable called 'tStat'.
  CorrectAnswer: tStat <- numer/denom
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=tStat <- numer/denom
  Hint: Type 'tStat <- numer/denom' to compute the t-statistic and store it in a new
    variable called 'tStat'.

- Class: text
  Output: Now that we have our t-statistic, we must compare it to our t critical value.
    In order to do this, we need to specify the t distribution corresponding to the
    correct degrees of freedom. In this case we cannot assume a common variance since
    we have independent sample variances. The formula for calculating the degrees
    of freedom is fairly complex and you are not expected to have committed it to
    memory.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Therefore, use the following equation in order to compute the degrees of
    freedom for this two sample test and store it in a new variable called ''myDF'':
    (sampVarManMPG/nMan + sampVarAutoMPG/nAuto)^2 / ((sampVarManMPG/nMan)^2/(nMan
    - 1) + (sampVarAutoMPG/nAuto)^2/(nAuto - 1))'
  CorrectAnswer: myDF <- (sampVarManMPG/nMan + sampVarAutoMPG/nAuto)^2 / ((sampVarManMPG/nMan)^2/(nMan
    - 1) + (sampVarAutoMPG/nAuto)^2/(nAuto - 1))
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=myDF <- (sampVarManMPG/nMan + sampVarAutoMPG/nAuto)^2 / ((sampVarManMPG/nMan)^2/(nMan
    - 1) + (sampVarAutoMPG/nAuto)^2/(nAuto - 1))
  Hint: Copy and paste the provided formula and store it in a new variable called
    'myDF'.

- Class: text
  Output: Before moving on to our final calculations, let's view the contents of the
    variables involved. Remember that typing a variable's name and pressing Enter
    will show you the contents of that variable.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: View the contents of our t-statistic variable, 'tStat', now.
  CorrectAnswer: tStat
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=tStat
  Hint: Type 'tStat' and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: View the contents of our degrees of freedom variable, 'myDF', now.
  CorrectAnswer: myDF
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=myDF
  Hint: Type 'myDF' and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Remember that a p-value gives us the probability of getting a t-statistic
    as or more extreme than the one we actually got from the data. Therefore, since
    we have a positive t-statistic here, we want to first find the area under the
    t-distribution curve to the right of the value of our t-statistic. Then, since
    the t-distribution is symmetrical about 0, we can multiply this value by 2 to
    get the p-value for a two-sided test.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's compute the area under the curve to the right of our t-statistic using
    R's 'pt' function. As a reminder, the 'pt' function requires that you specify
    the variable name of your test statistic, that 'df' equals the variable name of
    your degrees of freedom, and that you clarify whether you are looking to the left
    or the right of your t-statistic. If you are interested in the upper tail (which
    we are here) then you need to include the specification 'lower.tail=FALSE'. If
    you are looking to the left at the lower tail then you do not need to include
    anything additional.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the 'pt' function to compute the probability of getting a t-statistic
    that's greater than the value of the one we got and store this quanitity to a
    new variable called 'pVal1'. If you can't figure this one out on your own, then
    the hint will help you.
  CorrectAnswer: pVal1 <- pt(tStat, df = myDF, lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=pVal1 <- pt(tStat, df = myDF, lower.tail=FALSE)
  Hint: Type 'pVal1 <- pt(tStat, df = myDF, lower.tail=FALSE)' and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: To reiterate, the variable 'pVal1' now stores the probability of getting
    a t-statistic greater than or equal to the one we got. However, since we are interested
    in both extremes (i.e. a two-sided test), we must multiply this probability by
    2 to get our official p-value!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Let''s do this now. Assign the new probability to the variable ''pVal'' '
  CorrectAnswer: pVal <- pVal1*2
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=pVal <- pVal1*2
  Hint: Type 'pVal <- pVal1*2' without quotes and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at the value of our p-value. Type 'pVal' and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: pVal
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=pVal
  Hint: Type 'pVal' and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Since our p-value is well below 0.05 (the most commonly used significance
    level), we can safely reject our null hypothesis and conclude that there is a
    statistically significant difference in miles per gallon between cars with automatic
    and manual transmissions.

- Class: text
  Output: The most likely explanation for this difference is that most of the cars
    with manual transmissions are lighter in weight than those with automatic transmissions.
    As we mentioned in the last lesson, lower vehicle weight is typically associated
    with increased fuel efficiency.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's use the 't.test' function we learned in the previous lesson to ensure
    that our manual calculations are correct. This time you need to specify the variable
    name corresponding to the group of cars with automatic transmissions, the variable
    name corresponding to the group of cars with manual transmissions, and whether
    the test is one-sided or two-sided, by setting 'alternative' equal to either "one.sided"
    or "two.sided" (notice the double quotes around these).
  CorrectAnswer: t.test(autoMPG, manMPG, alternative="two.sided")
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=t.test(autoMPG, manMPG, alternative="two.sided")
  Hint: Type 't.test(autoMPG, manMPG, alternative="two.sided")' and press Enter. Make
    sure to put double quotes around the 'alternative'.

- Class: text
  Output: Success!!! Your p-values are equal! In the future, using the 't.test' function
    will save you time and reduce your chances of making a computational error. However,
    it's important for you to understand the calculations behind the t-test procedure
    when comparing two groups, so that you properly interpret the results.
