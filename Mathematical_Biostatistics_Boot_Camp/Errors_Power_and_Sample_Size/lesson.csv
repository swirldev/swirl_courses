text,"In this lesson, we will discuss type I and type II errors as well as the closely related concepts of power and sample size calculation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"A type I error, also known as a false positive, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true. When performing a statistical test, the type I error rate is typically predetermined by the statistician performing the test and is equivalent to the significance level of the test. Type I error is generally represented by the Greek letter 'alpha'.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
mult_question,Another name for a type I error is ___________.,beta; true positive; false negative; alpha,alpha,word= alpha,Review the previous paragraph.,NA,NA,NA
text,"On the other hand, a type II error, also known as a false negative, is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false. Notice that we intentionally avoid saying that one 'accepts the null hypothesis' in favor of saying that one 'fails to reject the null hypothesis'. This is comparable to the way in which a court of law avoids declaring someone to be innocent in favor of declaring someone to be not guilty. Type II error is generally represented by the Greek letter 'beta'.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
mult_question,Another name for a type II error is ___________.,false positive; false negative; alpha; true positive,false negative,word= false negative,Review the previous paragraph.,NA,NA,NA
text,"The concept of power is closely related to that of a type II error. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false. Since the type II error rate is the probability of INCORRECTLY rejecting the null hypothesis and power is the probability of CORRECTLY rejecting the null hypothesis, power is therefore equal to one minus the type II error rate (or in mathematical terms, power = 1 - beta). ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
mult_question,Another name for power is ___________.,true positive; beta; true negative; false negative,true positive,word= true positive,Power is the probability of CORRECTLY detecting something (i.e. having a 'positive' test result).,NA,NA,NA
text,"You are part of a research team conducting an experiment on the effectiveness of a new test that is designed to detect the presence of a deadly disease. Existing methods of detecting this disease are extremely reliable, but also very expensive. The appeal of this new test is that it is significantly cheaper than the existing method, although it may not be quite as reliable.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"To estabilish the validity of your new test, your team performs both the new test and the existing test on a large group of consenting individuals. It is assumed that the diagnosis given by the existing test is the true diagnosis. The new test performs as follows: Among people who actually have the disease (as diagnosed by the existing test) the new test correctly diagnoses 80% as having the disease and fails to correctly diagnose the remaining 20%. Among people who do not have the disease, the new test incorrectly diagnoses 4% as having the disease and correctly diagnoses the remaining 96% as not having the disease. Keep in mind that when performing a diagnostic test, the null hypothesis is always that the patient does not have the disease of interest.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

text,"For the remainder of the lesson, we will shift our focus to power and its important role in sample size calculations for experiments.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"In the lecture, you learned how to compute power given a large sample size and a known population standard deviation (or sigma). This is an important calculation to understand, but we will not review it here.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Instead, our focus will be on reversing this calculation to compute the sample size required to achieve a desired level of power (again, given a known sigma.) This calculation is most commonly used when designing experiments in order to ensure sample size is large enough to guarantee a powerful result.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Note that assuming a known sigma allows us to use the standard normal distribution in place of the t-distribution. We make this simplifying assumption here for the sake of conveying the concept at hand. Later in the lesson, we will review the more complicated process of computing sample size when sigma is unknown. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Here are the values we need for our first sample size calculation: population standard deviation (sigma), the difference in means we'd like to be able to detect (delta), the z-critical value for our chosen significance level, and the z-critical value corresponding to our desired level of power.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Let's work through an example. Pretend a road by your house has a posted speed limit of 65 miles per hour. You are interested in knowing if the true average speed at which cars travel on this road during rush hour is greater than or equal to 5 miles per hour ABOVE the speed limit (delta). To determine this, you will measure the speed at which a random selection of cars passes you on the road during rush hour. Assume a significance level of 0.05 (alpha) and that the population standard deviation in speed among all cars at this time is 10 miles per hour (sigma). Let's determine how many cars you will need to record so that you have an 80% chance of detecting a true difference of 5 or more miles per hour (power).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
mult_question,"For this experiment, are we interested in a one-sided or two-sided test?","One-sided; Two-sided; Neither, that's a trick question!",One-sided,word= One-sided,"In this example, are you interested in knowing whether cars are travelling at speeds lower than the posted speed limit?",NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,Now let's define the variables we'll use in our sample size calculation. Assign the appropriate value to a new variable called 'sigma'.,NA,sigma <- 10,swirl1cmd=sigma <- 10,Sigma represents the true population standard deviation of speeds.,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,Assign the appropriate value to a new variable called 'delta'.,NA,delta <- 5,swirl1cmd=delta <- 5,Delta represents the difference in true average speeds that you would like to be able to detect.,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"Since our significance level is 0.05, we need to find the z-critical value for which 5% of the standard normal distribution lies above it. In other words, 95% of the standard normal distribution falls below this point. This '95th percentile' is also called a '0.95 quantile', and is thus found with the 'qnorm' function in R ('q' for 'quantile' and 'norm' for 'normal'). Use this function now on the value 0.95 and assign the result to a new variable called 'zAlpha'.",NA,zAlpha <- qnorm(0.95),swirl1cmd=zAlpha <- qnorm(0.95),Type 'qnorm(0.95)' to find the value of the 0.95 quantile.,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"Since our desired power level is 80%, that means that we want to design our study in such a way that we have an 80% chance of correctly rejecting our null hypothesis. Thus our corresponding z-critical value should have 80% of the standard normal distribution lying above it and hence 20% below it. Use the 'qnorm' function again to find the 20th percentile and assign the result to a new variable called 'zBeta'.",NA,zBeta <- qnorm(0.20),swirl1cmd=zBeta <- qnorm(0.20),The 20th percentile is also known as the 0.20 quantile and can be found in the same way as you found the 0.95 quantile above.,NA,NA,NA
text,"We now have everything we need to compute our required sample size. Since it's a bit challenging to express the sample size formula in words, I'm going to give you the code for computing it below.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"To compute the sample size required to achieve 80% power in our example, type the following: '(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2'. Note that 'x^2' is R notation for 'x-squared' or 'x to the power of 2'.",NA,(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2,swirl1cmd=(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2,Type '(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2' and press Enter.,NA,NA,NA
text,"Now that you've computed the required sample size manually, let's perform the same task using a function from the R package called 'pwr'. In case you're new to R packages, they are simply libraries of additional functions that people like you have created for everyone to use. Normally,  you would have to load a new package on your own using the 'library' function, but for simplicity we have already done this for you here.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"The function we will use is called 'pwr.norm.test' and it will automatically generate the sample size required for 80% power once we specify the necessary information. Here are the items we need to give it: effect size (which is the difference we wish to detect divided by sigma), significance level, power, and whether we are conducting a one- or two-sided test.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"First, compute the effect size using the variables 'delta' and 'sigma', both of which you've already computed. Save the result in a new variable called 'effectSize'.",NA,effectSize <- delta / sigma,swirl1cmd=effectSize <- delta / sigma,Divide 'delta' by 'sigma' and assign the result to a new variable called 'effectSize'.,NA,NA,NA
text,"We already know the significance and power levels that we want and we are interested in a one-sided test. In this case, our one-sided test applies only to the case when the true speed is GREATER or equal to 10 miles per hour above the posted speed limit. Therefore, we will specifiy the test type as ""greater"".",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"You now have everything you need to call the 'pwr.norm.test' function. Here is the format: 'pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative=""greater"")'. Enter this now.",NA,"pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative=""greater"")","swirl1cmd=pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative=""greater"")","Type 'pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative=""greater"")' and press Enter.",NA,NA,NA
text,"This function provides several items of interest, but the only one we are concerned with here is the value of 'n', which is our sample size required to achieve a power of 80% in this scenario. You'll notice that it perfectly matches the result you got when doing the manual calculation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Since the sample size is reported as a decimal number, it is good practice to round up to the nearest whole number since we generally can't study a fraction of a car (person, mouse, etc.)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Up until this point, we've assumed a known population standard deviation (sigma). Sometimes this is available if a subject has be studied extensively, but this may often not be the case. If you are required to compute sigma from the data, then using a t-test is more appropriate.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"Doing this manually is considerably more involved for reasons we won't review here, so we'll instead use the t-test version of the function I just showed you above. The name of this function is 'pwr.t.test' and it is also found in the 'pwr' package.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"The inputs to the 'pwr.t.test' function are identical to 'pwr.norm.test' with only one exception. You must specify whether we are doing a one-sample, two-sample, or paired t-test analysis. In this case we are doing a one-sample analysis so the 'type' parameter will equal ""one.sample"".",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
cmd_question,"Perform the t-test version of your sample size calculation now using the following code: 'pwr.t.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, type=""one.sample"", alternative=""greater"")'",NA,"pwr.t.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, type=""one.sample"", alternative=""greater"")","swirl1cmd=pwr.t.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, type=""one.sample"", alternative=""greater"")","Type 'pwr.t.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, type=""one.sample"", alternative=""greater"")' and press Enter.",NA,NA,NA
text,"You'll notice that the required sample size using the t-test is larger than the required sample size using the normal distribution. Since we are estimating the standard deviation instead of assuming a known quantity, we are introducing more uncertainty into the process. Hence, a t-test provides a more conservative estimate of the required sample size. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
