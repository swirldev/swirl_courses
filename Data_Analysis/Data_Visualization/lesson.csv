text,"It is useful to first visualize the data before a statistician engages in a thorough analysis of the data set. In this lesson, we are going to learn useful techniques for visualizing numerical variables.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"By organizing the data into a PLOT or GRAPH, a statistician is able to explore and summarize some basic properties of the data set. The discipline of quantitatively describing the main properties of a data set is known as DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"The simplest type of plot is the DOT PLOT, which is used to visually convey the values of one variable. In a dot plot, there is only a horizontal x-axis, and the data points are represented as dots above this axis.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
figure,"
Here is a dot plot created using the variable 'price' from our 'cars' data set. As you may notice, the price is reported along the x-axis in $1000s, and each point above the axis represents the price of one of the
54 cars in our data set.",NA,NA,NA,NA,mod1_dotplot.R,new,NA,dot plot

text,"Since dot plots effectively display the specific numerical value of one variable for each individual in the data set, they are particularly useful when analyzing smaller data sets.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
text,"A HISTOGRAM is similar to a dot plot, but instead of showing every specific value, it partitions the values of your data into several bins, providing a more condensed representation of the data.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,histogram
figure,"Here I have created a histogram using the miles per gallon data for all of our cars. As you may notice, the values of the MPG along the x-axis are partitioned into bins with a range of 5. The second bin, for example, groups together all of the cars that get 21-25 MPG in the city, and so forth. Note that the bin to the left of this contains those cars with 20 MPG since this value cannot be counted in both bins. The frequency of values in each bin, or the number of cars in each of the intervals, is reported along the y-axis.",NA,NA,NA,NA,mod1_histogram.R,new,NA,histogram
text,"Taller bars signify the range of values in which the majority of the data is located, whereas shorter bars represent a range of values in which only a little bit of the data is located. In other words, histograms provide a view of the DATA DENSITY.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,histogram
mult_question,"By simply looking at this histogram, can you tell me which MPG interval has the highest frequency of values? For example, the lowest frequencies of values occur in the intervals 36-40, 41-45, and 46-50.",16-20; 21-25; 26-30; 31-35; 36-40; 41-45; 46-50,16-20,word= 16-20,Look for the bin values corresponding to the tallest bar in the histogram. ,NA,NA,NA,histogram

text,"Histograms are particularly useful in viewing and describing the shape of the distribution of the data. A distribution of data may have a left skew, a right skew, or no skew at all. SKEWNESS is a measure of the extent to which the distribution of the data 'leans' to one side or the other. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,classifying shape of a distribution
figure,"A distribution that has a left skew is one in which the left TAIL of the plot is longer. In other words, on a histogram the majority of the distribution is located to the right of the mean. ",NA,NA,NA,NA,mod1_leftskew.R,new,NA,classifying shape of a distribution
text,"When a distribution is left-skewed, the value of the MEAN is less than that of the MEDIAN, and thus the MEAN is located further to the left of the distribution. In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents the mean.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,classifying shape of a distribution

mult_question,How would you classify the shape of the distribution represented by this histogram?,Symmetric; Right-skewed; Left-skewed,Right-skewed,word= Right-skewed,"Look to see which end of the tail extends longer.

text,"A special type of histogram is known as a STEM-AND-LEAF PLOT. This plot organizes numerical data in order of decimal place value. The left-hand column of the plot contains the STEMS, or the numerical values of the tens digit for each of the data points, organized vertically in increasing order.
