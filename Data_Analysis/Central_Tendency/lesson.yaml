- Class: text
  Output: Today, I'll be teaching you the basics of data analysis. It probably makes
    sense to start by defining the word DATA.

- Class: text
  Output: According to Wikipedia, "Data are values of qualitative or quantitative
    variables, belonging to a set of items."

- Class: text
  Output: Often the "set of items" that we are interested in studying is referred
    to as the POPULATION. Data analysis usually involves studying a subset, or SAMPLE,
    of an entire population.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here is a diagram showing the relationship between a population and a sample.
  Figure: mod1_pop_vs_samp.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: Data analysis should always start with a specific question of interest.
    For example, we might ask "What percentage of people living in the United States
    are over six feet tall?"

- Class: text
  Output: Here, our population of interest is everyone living in the US. Since it's
    impractical to measure the heights of over 300 million people, we could instead
    choose 100 people at random and measure their heights. Our hope would be that
    this sample of 100 people is REPRESENTATIVE of the entire US population.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Let''s quickly test your understanding of the term REPRESENTATIVE. If you
    were interested in studying the health of men living in the US, ages 18-25, which
    sample would be more representative of the target population: a sample of 50 men
    who live in a nearby retirement home, or a sample of 50 men who are students at
    a local university?'
  AnswerChoices: Men living at the retirement home; College students
  CorrectAnswer: College students
  AnswerTests: word= College students
  Hint: Since your target population is all men ages 18-25 living in the US, which
    of these 2 sample populations more closely matches the population of interest?

- Class: text
  Output: The purpose of analyzing a sample is to draw conclusions about the population
    from which the sample was selected. This is called INFERENCE and is the primary
    goal of INFERENTIAL STATISTICS.

- Class: text
  Output: In order to make any inferences about the population, we first need to describe
    the sample. This is the primary goal of DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS.

- Class: text
  Output: If we want to describe our sample using just one number, how would we best
    do it? A good start is to find the center, the middle, or the most common element
    of our data. Statisticians call this the CENTRAL TENDENCY.

- Class: text
  Output: There are three different methods for finding such a number and the applicability
    of each method depends on the situation. Those three methods are called the MEAN,
    MEDIAN, and MODE.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Mean, median, and mode are all measures of ____________.
  AnswerChoices: variation; significance; deviation; central tendency
  CorrectAnswer: central tendency
  AnswerTests: word=central tendency
  Hint: This is a fancy term for the "middle" of a dataset.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following terms are of most importance when describing the
    central tendency of a data set?
  AnswerChoices: median, mode, range; statistics, population, mode; population, sample,
    representative; mode, median, mean
  CorrectAnswer: mode, median, mean
  AnswerTests: word= mode, median, mean
  Hint: These are the three different methods  stated above that are used for describing
    the center of a data set.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To illustrate these concepts, we will now look at a real dataset from the
    'openintro' R package, which has already been loaded for you. Type 'cars' and
    press Enter to see the dataset we'll be working with.
  CorrectAnswer: cars
  AnswerTests: equivalent=cars
  Hint: Type 'cars' and press Enter. Do not use quotes, spaces, or uppercase letters.

- Class: text
  Output: 'You''ll notice the rows are numbered 1 through 54, each representing exactly
    one car in the dataset. For each car, the following VARIABLES, or characteristics,
    are reported: ''type'' (small, midsize, large), ''price'' (USD), ''mpgCity'' (city
    miles per gallon), ''driveTrain'' (4WD, front, rear), ''passengers'' (total capacity),
    and ''weight'' (lbs). '

- Class: text
  Output: We'll be focusing on the 'mpgCity' variable in this lesson. For simplicity,
    let's extract it from our dataset and store it in a new variable.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Access the 'mpgCity' variable from the 'cars' dataset using the 'dataset$variable'
    notation.
  CorrectAnswer: cars$mpgCity
  AnswerTests: equivalent=cars$mpgCity
  Hint: Use 'dataset$variable' notation. Remember the name of our dataset is 'cars'
    and the name of the variable we are interested in is 'mpgCity'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now store the contents of the 'cars$mpgCity' in a new variable called 'myMPG'.
  CorrectAnswer: myMPG <- cars$mpgCity
  AnswerTests: newcmd=myMPG <- cars$mpgCity
  Hint: Use the assignment operator to assign 'cars$mpgCity' to a new variable called
    'myMPG'.

- Class: text
  Output: The ARITHMETIC MEAN, or simply the MEAN or AVERAGE, is the most common measurement
    of central tendency. To calculate the mean of a dataset, you first sum all of
    the values and then divide that sum by the total number of values in the dataset.

- Class: text
  Output: However, when there are many values of interest, it becomes tedious to do
    this calculation by hand. Luckily, R has a built-in function for computing the
    mean. The syntax for doing so is 'mean(variable)'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Compute the mean value for the 'myMPG' variable now.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(myMPG)
  AnswerTests: newcmd=mean(myMPG)
  Hint: Use the 'mean' function by typing 'mean' followed by the name of your variable
    placed in parentheses. Don't use any spaces.

- Class: text
  Output: Extreme values in our dataset can have a significant influence on the mean.
    For instance, if there was a car in our dataset that got 200 miles per gallon,
    this would inflate the mean upwards. This could be misleading since none of the
    other cars get anywhere near this gas mileage.

- Class: text
  Output: An alternative to the mean, which is not influenced at all by extreme values,
    is the MEDIAN. The median is computed by sorting all values from least to greatest
    and then selecting the middle value. If there is an even number of values, then
    there are actually 2 middle values. In this case, the MEDIAN is equal to the MEAN
    of the 2 middle values. Don't worry if this is a little confusing. It will become
    more clear with practice.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: R also has a function for computing the median of a dataset and this is
    done by typing 'median(variable)'. Find the median value of your 'myMPG' variable
    now.
  CorrectAnswer: median(myMPG)
  AnswerTests: newcmd=median(myMPG)
  Hint: Use the 'median' function by typing 'median' followed by the name of your
    variable placed in parentheses. Don't use any spaces.

- Class: text
  Output: Finally, we may be most interested in finding the value that shows up the
    most in our dataset. In other words, what is the most common value in our dataset?
    This is called the MODE and it is found by counting the number of times that each
    value appears in the dataset and selecting the most frequent value.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the 'table' function to see how many times each value appears for your
    'myMPG' variable. The syntax for this function is the same as for the others you've
    seen.
  CorrectAnswer: table(myMPG)
  AnswerTests: newcmd=table(myMPG)
  Hint: Type 'table' followed by your variable name placed in parentheses. As usual,
    leave out the spaces.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Look at your table for the 'myMPG' variable that you created above. The
    first row gives you the value of your variable and the second row gives you the
    number of times it appears in your dataset. Since the mode is the value of our
    variable that appears most frequently, what is the mode of your 'myMPG' variable?
  CorrectAnswer: '19'
  AnswerTests: exact=19
  Hint: Keep in mind that the mode is the value of the variable that is most common,
    NOT the number of times which it appears.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Congratulations! You''ve made it through your first lesson. We introduced
    basic concepts related to data and data analysis. Specifically, you learned three
    important measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode. You also know
    how to compute these using R.'
