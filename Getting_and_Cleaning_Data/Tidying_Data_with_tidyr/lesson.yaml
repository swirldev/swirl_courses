  Course: Getting and Cleaning Data
  Lesson: Tidying Data with tidyr
  Author: Nick Carchedi
  Type: Coursera
  Organization: JHU Biostat
  Version: 2.2.14

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you'll learn how to tidy your data with the tidyr package.

- Class: text
  Output: Parts of this lesson will require the use of dplyr. If you don't have a basic knowledge of dplyr, you should exit this lesson and begin with the dplyr lessons from earlier in the course.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: tidyr was automatically installed (if necessary) and loaded when you started this lesson. Just to build the habit, (re)load the package with library(tidyr).
  CorrectAnswer: library(tidyr)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('library(tidyr)')
  Hint: Type library(tidyr) to (re)load the tidyr package.

- Class: text
  Output: "The author of tidyr, Hadley Wickham, discusses his philosophy of tidy data in his 'Tidy Data' paper:\n\nhttp://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf\n\nThis paper should be required reading for anyone who works with data, but it's not required in order to complete this lesson."

- Class: text
  Output: "Tidy data is formatted in a standard way that facilitates exploration and analysis and works seamlessly with other tidy data tools. Specifically, tidy data satisfies three conditions:\n\n1) Each variable forms a column\n\n2) Each observation forms a row\n\n3) Each type of observational unit forms a table"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Any dataset that doesn't satisfy these conditions is considered 'messy' data. Therefore, all of the following are characteristics of messy data, EXCEPT...
  AnswerChoices: Every column contains a different variable; Column headers are values, not variable names; Multiple variables are stored in one column; Variables are stored in both rows and columns; Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table; A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables
  CorrectAnswer: Every column contains a different variable
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Every column contains a different variable')
  Hint: Scroll up to review the three characteristics of tidy data. Any dataset that violates at least one of these is considered messy. Therefore, all of the following are characteristics of messy data, EXCEPT...

- Class: text
  Output: The incorrect answers to the previous question are the most common symptoms of messy data. Let's work through a simple example of each of these five cases, then tidy some real data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The first problem is when you have column headers that are values, not variable names. I've created a simple dataset called 'students' that demonstrates this scenario. Type students to take a look.
  CorrectAnswer: students
  AnswerTests: prints_var('students')
  Hint: Type students to view the data.

- Class: text
  Output: The first column represents each of five possible grades that students could receive for a particular class. The second and third columns give the number of male and female students, respectively, that received each grade.

- Class: text
  Output: "This dataset actually has three variables: grade, sex, and count. The first variable, grade, is already a column, so that should remain as it is. The second variable, sex, is captured by the second and third column headings. The third variable, count, is the number of students for each combination of grade and sex."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To tidy the students data, we need to have one column for each of these three variables. We'll use the gather() function from tidyr to accomplish this. Pull up the documentation for this function with ?gather.
  CorrectAnswer: ?gather
  AnswerTests: gets_help('gather')
  Hint: Use ?gather to pull up the documentation.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Using the help file as a guide, call gather() with the following arguments (in order): students, sex, count, -grade. Note the minus sign before grade, which says we want to gather all columns EXCEPT grade."
  CorrectAnswer: gather(students, sex, count, -grade)
  AnswerTests: match_call('gather(students, sex, count, -grade)')
  Hint: "gather(students, sex, count, -grade) will properly tidy the students data, so that it has three columns: grade, sex, and count."

- Class: text
  Output: Each row of the data now represents exactly one observation, characterized by a unique combination of the grade and sex variables. Each of our variables (grade, sex, and count) occupies exactly one column. That's tidy data!

- Class: text
  Output: It's important to understand what each argument to gather() means. The data argument, students, gives the name of the original dataset. The key and value arguments -- sex and count, respectively -- give the column names for our tidy dataset. The final argument, -grade, says that we want to gather all columns EXCEPT the grade column (since grade is already a proper column variable.)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The second messy data case we'll look at is when multiple variables are stored in one column. Type students2 to see an example of this.
  CorrectAnswer: students2
  AnswerTests: prints_var('students2')
  Hint: Type students2 to view the data.

- Class: text
  Output: This dataset is similar to the first, except now there are two separate classes, 1 and 2, and we have total counts for each sex within each class. students2 suffers from the same messy data problem of having column headers that are values (male_1, female_1, etc.) and not variable names (sex, class, and count).

- Class: text
  Output: However, it also has multiple variables stored in each column (sex and class), which is another common symptom of messy data. Tidying this dataset will be a two step process.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by using gather() to stack the columns of students2, like we just did with students. This time, name the 'key' column sex_class and the 'value' column count. Save the result to a new variable called res. Consult ?gather again if you need help.
  CorrectAnswer: res <- gather(students2, sex_class, count, -grade)
  AnswerTests: match_call('res <- gather(students2, sex_class, count, -grade)')
  Hint: "Call gather() with the following arguments (in order): students2, sex_class, count, -grade). Store the result in a variable called res."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print res to the console to see what we accomplished.
  CorrectAnswer: res
  AnswerTests: prints_var('res')
  Hint: Type res to view its contents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: That got us half way to tidy data, but we still have two different variables, sex and class, stored together in the sex_class column. tidyr offers a convenient separate() function for the purpose of separating one column into multiple columns. Pull up the help file for separate() now.
  CorrectAnswer: ?separate
  AnswerTests: gets_help('separate')
  Hint: Type ?separate to pull up the help file.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Call separate() on res to split the sex_class column into sex and class. You only need to specify the first three arguments: data = res, col = sex_class, into = c("sex", "class"). You don''t have to provide the argument names as long as they are in the correct order.'
  CorrectAnswer: separate(res, sex_class, c("sex", "class"))
  AnswerTests: match_call('separate(res, sex_class, c("sex", "class"))')
  Hint: separate(res, sex_class, c("sex", "class")) will split the sex_class column into sex and class.

- Class: text
  Output: Conveniently, separate() was able to figure out on its own how to separate the sex_class column. Unless you request otherwise with the 'sep' argument, it splits on non-alphanumeric values. In other words, it assumes that the values are separated by something other than a letter or number (in this case, an underscore.)

- Class: text
  Output: Tidying students2 required both gather() and separate(), causing us to save an intermediate result (res). However, just like with dplyr, you can use the %>% operator to chain multiple function calls together.

- Class: script
  Output: I've opened an R script for you to give this a try. Follow the directions in the script, then save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready. If you get stuck and want to start over, you can type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  Script: script1.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A third symptom of messy data is when variables are stored in both rows and columns. students3 provides an example of this. Print students3 to the console.
  CorrectAnswer: students3
  AnswerTests: prints_var('students3')
  Hint: Type students3 to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: In students3, we have midterm and final exam grades for five students, each of whom were enrolled in exactly two of five possible classes.

- Class: text
  Output: The first variable, name, is already a column and should remain as it is. The headers of the last five columns, class1 through class5, are all different values of what should be a class variable. The values in the test column, midterm and final, should each be its own variable containing the respective grades for each student.

- Class: script
  Output: This will require multiple steps, which we will build up gradually using %>%. Edit the R script, save it, then type submit() when you are ready. Type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  Script: script2.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The next step will require the use of spread(). Pull up the documentation for spread() now.
  CorrectAnswer: ?spread
  AnswerTests: gets_help('spread')
  Hint: Type ?spread to pull up the documentation.

- Class: script
  Output: Edit the R script, then save it and type submit() when you are ready. Type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  Script: script3.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Lastly, we want the values in the class column to simply be 1, 2, ..., 5 and not class1, class2, ..., class5. We can use the extract_numeric() function from tidyr to accomplish this. To see how it works, try extract_numeric("class5").
  CorrectAnswer: extract_numeric("class5")
  AnswerTests: omnitest('extract_numeric("class5")')
  Hint: Type extract_numeric("class5") to see how it works.

- Class: script
  Output: Now, the final step. Edit the R script, then save it and type submit() when you are ready. Type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  Script: script4.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The fourth messy data problem we'll look at occurs when multiple observational units are stored in the same table. students4 presents an example of this. Take a look at the data now.
  CorrectAnswer: students4
  AnswerTests: prints_var('students4')
  Hint: Type students4 to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: students4 is almost the same as our tidy version of students3. The only difference is that students4 provides a unique id for each student, as well as his or her sex (M = male; F = female).

- Class: text
  Output: At first glance, there doesn't seem to be much of a problem with students4. All columns are variables and all rows are observations. However, notice that each id, name, and sex is repeated twice, which seems quite redundant. This is a hint that our data contains multiple observational units in a single table.

- Class: script
  Output: "Our solution will be to break students4 into two separate tables -- one containing basic student information (id, name, and sex) and the other containing grades (id, class, midterm, final).\n\nEdit the R script, save it, then type submit() when you are ready. Type reset() to reset the script to its original state."
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  Script: script5.R

- Class: script
  Output: Notice anything strange about student_info? It contains five duplicate rows! See the script for directions on how to fix this. Save the script and type submit() when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  Script: script6.R

- Class: script
  Output: "Now, using the script I just opened for you, create a second table called gradebook using the id, class, midterm, and final columns (in that order).\n\nEdit the R script, save it, then type submit() when you are ready. Type reset() to reset the script to its original state."
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  Script: script7.R

- Class: text
  Output: It's important to note that we left the id column in both tables. In the world of relational databases, 'id' is called our 'primary key' since it allows us to connect each student listed in student_info with their grades listed in gradebook. Without a unique identifier, we might not know how the tables are related. (In this case, we could have also used the name variable, since each student happens to have a unique name.)

- Class: text
  Output: The fifth and final messy data scenario that we'll address is when a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. It's the opposite of the fourth problem.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To illustrate this, we've created two datasets, passed and failed. Take a look at passed now.
  CorrectAnswer: passed
  AnswerTests: prints_var('passed')
  Hint: Type passed to view its contents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now view the contents of failed.
  CorrectAnswer: failed
  AnswerTests: prints_var('failed')
  Hint: Type failed to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: Teachers decided to only take into consideration final exam grades in determining whether students passed or failed each class. As you may have inferred from the data, students passed a class if they received a final exam grade of A or B and failed otherwise.

- Class: text
  Output: The name of each dataset actually represents the value of a new variable that we will call 'status'. Before joining the two tables together, we'll add a new column to each containing this information so that its not lost when we put everything together.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use dplyr's mutate() to add a new column to the passed table. The column should be called status and the value, "passed" (a character string), should be the same for all students. 'Overwrite' the current version of passed with the new one.
  CorrectAnswer: passed <- passed %>% mutate(status = "passed")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('passed <- passed %>% mutate(status = "passed")', 'passed <- mutate(passed, status = "passed")')
  Hint: passed <- passed %>% mutate(status = "passed") will do the trick.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, do the same for the failed table, except the status column should have the value "failed" for all students.
  CorrectAnswer: failed <- failed %>% mutate(status = "failed")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('failed <- failed %>% mutate(status = "failed")', 'failed <- mutate(failed, status = "failed")')
  Hint: failed <- failed %>% mutate(status = "failed") is what you're looking for.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, pass as arguments the passed and failed tables (in order) to the dplyr function bind_rows(), which will join them together into a single unit. Check ?bind_rows if you need help.\n\nNote: bind_rows() is only available in dplyr 0.4.0 or later. If you have an older version of dplyr, please quit the lesson, update dplyr, then restart the lesson where you left off. If you're not sure what version of dplyr you have, type packageVersion('dplyr')."
  CorrectAnswer: bind_rows(passed, failed)
  AnswerTests: match_call('bind_rows(passed, failed)')
  Hint: Call bind_rows() with two arguments, passed and failed (in that order), to join the two tables.

- Class: text
  Output: Of course, we could arrange the rows however we wish at this point, but the important thing is that each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and the table contains a single observational unit. Thus, the data are tidy.

- Class: text
  Output: We've covered a lot in this lesson. Let's bring everything together and tidy a real dataset.

- Class: text
  Output: "The SAT is a popular college-readiness exam in the United States that consists of three sections: critical reading, mathematics, and writing. Students can earn up to 800 points on each section. This dataset presents the total number of students, for each combination of exam section and sex, within each of six score ranges. It comes from the 'Total Group Report 2013', which can be found here:\n\nhttp://research.collegeboard.org/programs/sat/data/cb-seniors-2013"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I've created a variable called 'sat' in your workspace, which contains data on all college-bound seniors who took the SAT exam in 2013. Print the dataset now.
  CorrectAnswer: sat
  AnswerTests: prints_var('sat')
  Hint: Type sat to view its contents.

- Class: script
  Output: As we've done before, we'll build up a series of chained commands, using functions from both tidyr and dplyr. Edit the R script, save it, then type submit() when you are ready. Type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  Script: script8.R

- Class: script
  Output: Finish off the job by following the directions in the script. Save the script and type submit() when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint: Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Save the script and type submit() at the prompt when you are ready, or type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  Script: script9.R

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you learned how to tidy data with tidyr and dplyr. These tools will help you spend less time and energy getting your data ready to analyze and more time actually analyzing it.
