  Version: 2.2.0

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we'll see how to extract elements from a vector based on some conditions that we specify.

- Class: text
  Output: For example, we may only be interested in the first 20 elements of a vector, or only the elements that are not NA, or only those that are positive or correspond to a specific variable of interest. By the end of this lesson, you'll know how to handle each of these scenarios.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I've created for you a vector called x that contains a random ordering of 20 numbers (from a standard normal distribution) and 20 NAs. Type x now to see what it looks like.
  CorrectAnswer: x
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x')
  Hint: Type x to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: The way you tell R that you want to select some particular elements (i.e. a 'subset') from a vector is by placing an 'index vector' in square brackets immediately following the name of the vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For a simple example, try x[1:10] to view the first ten elements of x.
  CorrectAnswer: x[1:10]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[1:10]')
  Hint: View the first ten elements of x with x[1:10].

- Class: text
  Output: Index vectors come in four different flavors -- logical vectors, vectors of positive integers, vectors of negative integers, and vectors of character strings -- each of which we'll cover in this lesson.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's start by indexing with logical vectors. One common scenario when working with real-world data is that we want to extract all elements of a vector that are not NA (i.e. missing data). Recall that is.na(x) yields a vector of logical values the same length as x, with TRUEs corresponding to NA values in x and FALSEs corresponding to non-NA values in x.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you think x[is.na(x)] will give you?
  AnswerChoices: A vector of all NAs; A vector with no NAs; A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs; A vector of length 0
  CorrectAnswer: A vector of all NAs
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="A vector of all NAs")
  Hint: Remember that is.na(x) tells us where the NAs are in a vector. So if we subset x based on that, what do you expect to happen?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Prove it to yourself by typing x[is.na(x)].
  CorrectAnswer: x[is.na(x)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[is.na(x)]')
  Hint: Type x[is.na(x)] to see that you get all NAs, which is clearly not what we want!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Recall that `!` gives us the negation of a logical expression, so !is.na(x) can be read as 'is not NA'. Therefore, if we want to create a vector called y that contains all of the non-NA values from x, we can use y <- x[!is.na(x)]. Give it a try.
  CorrectAnswer: y <- x[!is.na(x)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='y <- x[!is.na(x)]')
  Hint: Type y <- x[!is.na(x)] to capture all non-missing values from x.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print y to the console.
  CorrectAnswer: 'y'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='y')
  Hint: Type y to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: Now that we've isolated the non-missing values of x and put them in y, we can subset y as we please.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Recall that the expression y > 0 will give us a vector of logical values the same length as y, with TRUEs corresponding to values of y that are greater than zero and FALSEs corresponding to values of y that are less than or equal to zero. What do you think y[y > 0] will give you?
  AnswerChoices: A vector of all the positive elements of y; A vector of all the negative elements of y; A vector of all NAs; A vector of length 0; A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
  CorrectAnswer: A vector of all the positive elements of y
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="A vector of all the positive elements of y")
  Hint: The logical expression y > 0 will give us TRUE for each element of y that is positive. Based on that, what do you think y[y > 0] will return?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type y[y > 0] to see that we get all of the positive elements of y, which are also the positive elements of our original vector x.
  CorrectAnswer: y[y > 0]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='y[y > 0]')
  Hint: Type y[y > 0] to view only the positive elements of y.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You might wonder why we didn't just start with x[x > 0] to isolate the positive elements of x. Try that now to see why.
  CorrectAnswer: x[x > 0]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[x > 0]')
  Hint: Try x[x > 0] to see why we didn't use this approach.

- Class: text
  Output: Since NA is not a value, but rather a placeholder for an unknown quantity, the expression NA > 0 evaluates to NA. Hence we get a bunch of NAs mixed in with our positive numbers when we do this.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Combining our knowledge of logical operators with our new knowledge of subsetting, we could do this -- x[!is.na(x) & x > 0]. Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: x[!is.na(x) & x > 0]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[!is.na(x) & x > 0]')
  Hint: Try x[!is.na(x) & x > 0] to see what you get.

- Class: text
  Output: In this case, we request only values of x that are both non-missing AND greater than zero.

- Class: text
  Output: I've already shown you how to subset just the first ten values of x using x[1:10]. In this case, we're providing a vector of positive integers inside of the square brackets, which tells R to return only the elements of x numbered 1 through 10.

- Class: text
  Output: Many programming languages use what's called 'zero-based indexing', which means that the first element of a vector is considered element 0. R uses 'one-based indexing', which (you guessed it!) means the first element of a vector is considered element 1.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Can you figure out how we'd subset the 3rd, 5th, and 7th elements of x? Hint -- Use the c() function to specify the element numbers as a numeric vector.
  CorrectAnswer: x[c(3, 5, 7)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[c(3, 5, 7)]')
  Hint: Create a vector of indexes with c(3, 5, 7), then put that inside of the square brackets.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: It's important that when using integer vectors to subset our vector x, we stick with the set of indexes {1, 2, ..., 40} since x only has 40 elements. What happens if we ask for the zeroth element of x (i.e. x[0])? Give it a try.
  CorrectAnswer: x[0]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[0]')
  Hint: Try x[0] to see what happens when we refer to the zeroth element of a vector, which is not defined in R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As you might expect, we get nothing useful. Unfortunately, R doesn't prevent us from doing this. What if we ask for the 3000th element of x? Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: x[3000]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[3000]')
  Hint: Request the 3000th element of x (which does not exist) with x[3000].

- Class: text
  Output: Again, nothing useful, but R doesn't prevent us from asking for it. This should be a cautionary tale. You should always make sure that what you are asking for is within the bounds of the vector you're working with.

- Class: text
  Output: What if we're interested in all elements of x EXCEPT the 2nd and 10th? It would be pretty tedious to construct a vector containing all numbers 1 through 40 EXCEPT 2 and 10.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Luckily, R accepts negative integer indexes. Whereas x[c(2, 10)] gives us ONLY the 2nd and 10th elements of x, x[c(-2, -10)] gives us all elements of x EXCEPT for the 2nd and 10 elements.  Try x[c(-2, -10)] now to see this.
  CorrectAnswer: x[c(-2, -10)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[c(-2, -10)]')
  Hint: Give x[c(-2, -10)] a try.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A shorthand way of specifying multiple negative numbers is to put the negative sign out in front of the vector of positive numbers. Type x[-c(2, 10)] to get the exact same result.
  CorrectAnswer: x[-c(2, 10)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x[-c(2, 10)]')
  Hint: Use x[-c(2, 10)] to simply things a bit. This could be a time saver if specifying many negative indexes.

- Class: text
  Output: So far, we've covered three types of index vectors -- logical, positive integer, and negative integer. The only remaining type requires us to introduce the concept of 'named' elements.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a numeric vector with three named elements using vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA).
  CorrectAnswer: vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA)')
  Hint: Create a named vector with vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: When we print vect to the console, you'll see that each element has a name. Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: vect
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vect')
  Hint: Type vect to view its contents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can also get the names of vect by passing vect as an argument to the names() function. Give that a try.
  CorrectAnswer: names(vect)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(vect)')
  Hint: Check out the results of names(vect).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Alternatively, we can create an unnamed vector vect2 with c(11, 2, NA). Do that now.
  CorrectAnswer: vect2 <- c(11, 2, NA)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vect2 <- c(11, 2, NA)')
  Hint: Create an ordinary (unnamed) vector called vect2 that contains c(11, 2, NA).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then, we can add the `names` attribute to vect2 after the fact with names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf"). Go ahead.
  CorrectAnswer: names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")')
  Hint: Add names to vect2 with names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf").

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's check that vect and vect2 are the same by passing them as arguments to the identical() function.
  CorrectAnswer: identical(vect, vect2)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('identical(vect, vect2)', 'identical(vect2, vect)')
  Hint: The identical() function tells us if its first two arguments are, well, identical.

- Class: text
  Output: Indeed, vect and vect2 are identical named vectors.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now, back to the matter of subsetting a vector by named elements. Which of the following commands do you think would give us the second element of vect?
  AnswerChoices: vect["bar"]; vect[bar]; vect["2"]
  CorrectAnswer: vect["bar"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='vect["bar"]')
  Hint: If we want the element named "bar" (i.e. the second element of vect), which command would get us that?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: vect["bar"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vect["bar"]')
  Hint: Try vect["bar"].

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Likewise, we can specify a vector of names with vect[c("foo", "bar")]. Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: vect[c("foo", "bar")]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vect[c("foo", "bar")]')
  Hint: Use vect[c("foo", "bar")] to get only the elements of vect named "foo" and "bar".

- Class: text
  Output: Now you know all four methods of subsetting data from vectors. Different approaches are best in different scenarios and when in doubt, try it out!
