- Class: text
  Output: This lesson is meant to be a short introduction to logical operations in R.

- Class: text
  Output: There are two logical values in R, also called boolean values. They are TRUE and FALSE. 
    In R you can construct logical expressions which will evaluate to either TRUE or FALSE.

- Class: text
  Output: "Many of the questions in this lesson will involve evaluating logical 
  expressions. It may be useful to open up a second R terminal where you can 
  experiment with some of these expressions."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Creating logical expressions requires logical operators. You're probably familiar with 
    arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. The first logical operator we are going to 
    discuss is the equality operator, represented by two equals signs `==`. Use the equality operator
    below to find out if TRUE is equal to TRUE.
  CorrectAnswer: TRUE == TRUE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='TRUE == TRUE')
  Hint: Use the equality operator and type TRUE == TRUE

- Class: text
  Output: Just like arithmetic, logical expressions can be grouped by parenthesis so that the entire expression
   (TRUE == TRUE) == TRUE evaluates to TRUE. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To test out this property, try evaluating (FALSE == TRUE) == FALSE .
  CorrectAnswer: (FALSE == TRUE) == FALSE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='(FALSE == TRUE) == FALSE')
  Hint: "Try typing: (FALSE == TRUE) == FALSE"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The equality operator can also be used to compare numbers. Use `==` to see if 6 is equal to 7.
  CorrectAnswer: 6 == 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='6 == 7')
  Hint: Use the equality operator and type 6 == 7

- Class: text
  Output: The previous expression evaluates to FALSE because 6 is less than 7. Thankfully, there
    are inequality operators that allow us to test if a value is less than or greater than another value.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The less than operator `<` tests whether the number on the left side of the operator 
    (called the left operand) is less than the number on the right side of the operator (called the
    right operand). Write an expression to test whether 6 is less than 7.
  CorrectAnswer: 6 < 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='6 < 7')
  Hint: Use the less than operator and type 6 < 7

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: There is also a less-than-or-equal-to operator `<=` which tests whether the left operand 
    is less than or equal to the right operand. Write an expression to test whether 10 is less than or equal to 10.
  CorrectAnswer: 10 <= 10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='10 <= 10')
  Hint: Use the `<=` operator and type 10 <= 10

- Class: text
  Output: Keep in mind that there are the corresponding greater than `>` and greater-than-or-equal-to
    `>=` operators.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which of the following evaluates to FALSE?'
  CorrectAnswer: 9 >= 10
  AnswerChoices: 9 >= 10; 7 == 7; 6 < 8; 0 > -36 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='9 >= 10')
  Hint: 'If you need to, you can evaluate each expression in a separate R session to find the correct answer.'

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which of the following evaluates to TRUE?'
  CorrectAnswer: 9 >= 10
  AnswerChoices: 9 >= 10; 7 == 9; 57 < 8; -6 > -7 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='-6 > -7')
  Hint: 'If you need to, you can evaluate each expression in a separate R session to find the correct answer.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The next operator we will discuss is the 'not equals' operator represented by `!=`. Not equals tests whether two
    values are unequal, so TRUE != FALSE evaluates to TRUE. Like the equality operator, `!=` can also
    be used with numbers. Try writing an expression to see if 5 is not equal to 7.
  CorrectAnswer: 5 != 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='5 != 7')
  Hint: Use the not equals operator and type 5 != 7

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "In order to negate boolean expressions you can use the NOT operator. An exclamation point `!` will cause
    !TRUE (say: not true) to evaluate to FALSE and !FALSE (say: not false) to evaluate to TRUE. Try using the NOT
    operator and the equals operator to find the opposite of whether 5 is equal to 7."
  CorrectAnswer: '!5 == 7'
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('!5 == 7', '!(5 == 7)')
  Hint: This expression may be a little tricky, so think about negating the expression 5 == 7 (all you need is an exclamation
    point in front).

- Class: text
  Output: Let's take a moment to review. The equals operator `==` tests whether two boolean values or numbers are equal,
    the not equals operator `!=` tests whether two boolean values or numbers are unequal, and the NOT operator `!` negates
    logical expressions so that TRUE expressions become FALSE and FALSE expressions become TRUE.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following evaluates to FALSE?
  CorrectAnswer: "!(0 >= -1)"
  AnswerChoices: "!(0 >= -1); !FALSE; 7 != 8; 9 < 10"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='!(0 >= -1)')
  Hint: 'If you need to, you can evaluate each expression in a separate R session to find the correct answer.'

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What do you think the following expression will evaluate to?: (TRUE != FALSE) == !(6 == 7)'
  CorrectAnswer: TRUE
  AnswerChoices: TRUE; FALSE; Can there be objective truth when programming?; %>%
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='TRUE')
  Hint: 'Try to evaluate each expression in isolation and build up an answer.'

- Class: text
  Output: At some point you may need to examine relationships between multiple logical expressions. 
    This is where the AND operator and the OR operator come in.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at how the AND operator works. There are two AND operators in R, `&` and `&&`.
    Both operators work similarly, if the right and left operands of AND are both TRUE the entire
    expression is TRUE, otherwise it is FALSE. For example, TRUE & TRUE evaluates to TRUE. Try typing 
    FALSE & FALSE to how it is evaluated.
  CorrectAnswer: FALSE & FALSE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='FALSE & FALSE')
  Hint: "Just to illustrate how the AND operator works type: FALSE & FALSE"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "You can use the `&` operator to evaluate AND across a vector. The `&&` version of AND only evaluates 
    the first member of a vector. Let's test both for practice. Type the expression TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)."
  CorrectAnswer: "TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)')
  Hint: "Now to see how the AND operator works with a vector, type: 
    TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"

- Class: text
  Output: What happens in this case is that the left operand `TRUE` is recycled
    across every element in the vector of the right operand. This is the equivalent
    statement as c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now we'll type the same expression except we'll use the `&&` operator. Type the expression TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)."
  CorrectAnswer: "TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)')
  Hint: "As you'll see, the && version of AND works differently. Type: 
    TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"

- Class: text
  Output: "In this case, the left operand is only evaluated with the first member
    of the right operand (the vector). The rest of the elements in the vector
    aren't evaluated at all in this expression."
    
- Class : text
  Output: The OR operator follows a similar set of rules. The `|` version of OR
    evaluates OR across an entire vector, while the `||` version of OR only evaluates
    the first member of a vector.
    
- Class : text
  Output: An expression using the OR operator will evaluate to TRUE if the left 
    operand or the right operand is TRUE. If both are TRUE, the expression will
    evaluate to TRUE, however if neither are TRUE, then the expression will be
    FALSE.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's test out the vectorized version of the OR operator. Type the 
    expression TRUE | c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)."
  CorrectAnswer: "TRUE | c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='TRUE | c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)')
  Hint: "Test out the vectorized OR operator by typing: TRUE | c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now let's try out the non-vectorized version of the OR operator. Type the 
    expression TRUE || c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)."
  CorrectAnswer: "TRUE || c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='TRUE || c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)')
  Hint: "As you'll see the || version of OR is not vectorized. Type: 
    TRUE || c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)"
  
- Class : text
  Output: "Logical operators can be chained together just like arithmetic operators.
    The expressions: `6 != 10 && FALSE && 1 >= 2` or `TRUE || 5 < 9.3 
    || FALSE` are perfectly normal to see."
  
- Class : cmd_question
  Output: "As you may recall, arithmetic has an order of operations and so do logical
    expressions. All AND operators are evaluated before OR operators. Let's look at
    an example of an ambiguous case. Type: 5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9"
  CorrectAnswer: "5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9')
  Hint: "See how the order of operations works by typing: 
    5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9"
  
- Class : text
  Output: "Let's walk through the order of operations in the above case. First the
    left and right operands of the AND operator are evaluated. 6 is not equal 8, 
    4 is greater than 3.9, therefore both operands are TRUE so the resulting expression 
    `TRUE && TRUE` evaluates to TRUE. Then the left operand of the OR operator is 
    evaluated: 5 is not greater than 8 so the entire expression is reduced to FALSE
    || TRUE. Since the right operand of this expression is TRUE the entire expression
    evaluates to TRUE."
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which one of the following expressions evaluates to TRUE?
  CorrectAnswer: "TRUE && FALSE || 9 >= 4 && 3 < 6"
  AnswerChoices: "TRUE && FALSE || 9 >= 4 && 3 < 6; TRUE && 62 < 62 && 44 >= 44; 99.99 > 100 || 45 < 7.3 || 4 != 4.0; FALSE || TRUE && FALSE"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='TRUE && FALSE || 9 >= 4 && 3 < 6')
  Hint: 'Try to evaluate each expression in isolation and build up an answer.'
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which one of the following expressions evaluates to FALSE?
  CorrectAnswer: "FALSE && 6 >= 6 || 7 >= 8 || 50 <= 49.5"
  AnswerChoices: "FALSE && 6 >= 6 || 7 >= 8 || 50 <= 49.5; FALSE || TRUE && 6 != 4 || 9 > 4; !(8 > 4) ||  5 == 5.0 && 7.8 >= 7.79; 6 >= -9 && !(6 > 7) && !(!TRUE)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='FALSE && 6 >= 6 || 7 >= 8 || 50 <= 49.5')
  Hint: 'Try to evaluate each expression in isolation and build up an answer.'

  Output: "Now that you're familiar with R's logical operators you can take advantage
    of a few functions that R provides for dealing with logical expressions."
    
- Class : cmd_question
  Output: "The function isTRUE() takes one argument. If that argument evaluates to
    TRUE, the function will return TRUE. Otherwise, the function will return FALSE.
    Try using this function by typing: isTRUE(6 > 4)"
  CorrectAnswer: "isTRUE(6 > 4)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='isTRUE(6 > 4)')
  Hint: "Test out isTRUE() by typing: isTRUE(6 > 4)"
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following evaluates to TRUE?
  CorrectAnswer: "!isTRUE(4 < 3)"
  AnswerChoices: "isTRUE(!TRUE); isTRUE(3); isTRUE(NA); !isTRUE(4 < 3); !isTRUE(8 != 5)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='!isTRUE(4 < 3)')
  Hint: 'isTRUE() will only return TRUE if the statement passed to it as an argument is TRUE.'
  
- Class : cmd_question
  Output: "The function identical() will return TRUE if the two R objects passed to it as arguments
    are identical. Try out the identical() function by typing: identical('twins', 'twins')"
  CorrectAnswer: "identical('twins', 'twins')"

  Hint: "identical() will only evaluate to TRUE if its arguments are exactly the same."
  
- Class : cmd_question
  Output: "You should also be aware of the xor() function, which takes two arguments. 
  The xor() function stands for exclusive OR.
  If one argument evaluates to TRUE and one argument evaluates to FALSE, then this
  function will return TRUE, otherwise it will return FALSE. Try out the xor() function
  by typing: xor(5 == 6, !FALSE)"
  CorrectAnswer: "xor(5 == 6, !FALSE)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='xor(5 == 6, !FALSE)')
  Hint: "Test out the xor() function by typing: xor(5 == 6, !FALSE)"
  
- Class : text
  Output: "5 == 6 evaluates to FALSE, !FALSE evaluates to TRUE, so xor(FALSE, TRUE)
    evaluates to TRUE. On the other hand if the first argument was changed to 5 == 5
    and the second argument was unchanged then both arguments would have been TRUE, 
    so xor(TRUE, TRUE) would have evaluated to FALSE."
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following evaluates to FALSE?
  CorrectAnswer: "xor(4 >= 9, 8 != 8.0)"
  AnswerChoices: "xor(4 >= 9, 8 != 8.0); xor(!isTRUE(TRUE), 6 > -1); xor(identical(xor, 'xor'), 7 == 7.0); xor(!!TRUE, !!FALSE)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='xor(4 >= 9, 8 != 8.0)')
  Hint: "For xor() to evaluate to TRUE, one argument must be TRUE and one must be FALSE."
