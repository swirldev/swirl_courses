  Lesson: Functions

  Organization: swirlstats
  Version: 2.2.14

- Class: text
  Output: Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of the R language. They are small 
    pieces of reusable code that can be treated like any other R object.

- Class: text
  Output: "If you've worked through any other part of this course, you've probably
    used some functions already. Functions are usually characterized by the name
    of the function followed by parentheses."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's try using a few basic functions just for fun. The Sys.Date()
    function returns a string representing today's date. Type Sys.Date() below 
      and see what happens."
  CorrectAnswer: Sys.Date()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Sys.Date()')
  Hint: "Display today's date by typing: Sys.Date()"

- Class: text
  Output: "Most functions in R return a value. Functions like Sys.Date() return a
    value based on your computer's environment, while other functions manipulate 
    input data in order to compute a return value."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The mean() function takes a vector of numbers as input, and returns
    the average of all of the numbers in the input vector. Inputs to functions
    are often called arguments. Providing arguments to a function is also
    sometimes called passing arguments to that function. Arguments you want to 
    pass to a function go inside the function's parentheses. Try passing the argument 
    c(2, 4, 5) to the mean() function."
  CorrectAnswer: mean(c(2, 4, 5))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(c(2, 4, 5))')
  Hint: "Compute the average of 2, 4, and 5 by typing: mean(c(2, 4, 5))"

- Class: text
  Output: Functions usually take arguments which are variables that the function operates on. For example,
    the mean() function takes a vector as as argument, like in the case of mean(c(2,6,8)). The mean()
    function then adds up all of the numbers in the vector and divides that sum by the
    length of the vector.

- Class: text
  Output: In the following question you will be asked to modify a script that will
    appear as soon as you move on from this question. When you have finished modifying
    the script, save your changes to the script and type submit() and the script
    will be evaluated. There will be some comments in the script that opens up, so be
    sure to read them!

- Class: script
  Output: The last R expression to be evaluated in a function will become the 
    return value of that function. We want this function to take one argument, 
    x, and return x without modifying it. Delete the pound
    sign so that x is returned without any modification. Make sure to save your
    script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: test_func1()
  Hint: Make sure to delete the pound sign so the last expression in the function is just x.
  Script: boring_function.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now that you've created your first function let's test it! Type: 
    boring_function('My first function!'). If your function works, it should
    just return the string: 'My first function!'"
  CorrectAnswer: "boring_function('My first function!')"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="boring_function('My first function!')")
  Hint: "Test boring_function by typing: boring_function('My first function!')"

- Class: text
  Output: "Congratulations on writing your first function. By writing functions,
    you can gain serious insight into how R works. As John Chambers, the creator
    of R once said:\n\n To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
    1. Everything that exists is an object. 2. Everything that happens is a function call."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "If you want to see the source code for any function, just type the
    function name without any arguments or parentheses. Let's try this out with
    the function you just created. Type: boring_function to view its source code."
  CorrectAnswer: boring_function
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boring_function')
  Hint: "To see the souce code for boring_function just type: boring_function"

- Class: text
  Output: "Time to make a more useful function! We're going to replicate the 
    functionality of the mean() function by creating a function called: my_mean().
    Remember that to calculate the average of all of the numbers in a vector you
    find the sum of all the numbers in the vector, and then divide that sum by the
    number of numbers in the vector." 

- Class: script
  Output: Make sure to save your script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: test_func2()
  Hint: "Use the sum() function to find the sum of all the numbers in the vector. Use
    the length() function to find the size of the vector."
  Script: my_mean.R
