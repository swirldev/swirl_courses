exact_question,"Now that you have calculated the standard deviation of this data, can you tell me what is the variance of the data? To square a quantity in R, the notation is 'quantity^2', where the '^' symbol means 'to the power of'.",NA,3.593072,exact=3.593072,Variance is the standard deviation squared.,NA,NA,NA,standard deviation and variance,,
text,"To demonstrate differences in variability, I will again refer to the box plot of car type vs. price.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,box-and-whisker plot,,
figure,"As you can see in the box plot, the data for prices of 'midsize' cars vary from around 15 to 62, encompassing a range of approximately 50. This is a great deal larger than the variation for 'small' cars which range from around 5 to 15, encompassing a range of approximately 10. Therefore, since the range is much greater for 'midsize' cars, prices of 'midsize' cars have much higher variability in comparison to the prices of 'small' cars.",NA,NA,NA,NA,mod1_boxplot.R,new,NA,box-and-whisker plot,,

text,"While dispersion measures the variability from the mean in a data set, another important property is the shape of the distribution of the data. We will learn much more about distributions in one of my subsequent lessons, but for now just think of DISTRIBUTION as a histogram.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,classifying shape of distributions,,
text,"Histograms are particularly useful in viewing and describing the shape of the distribution of the data. A distribution of data may have a left skew, a right skew, or no skew at all. SKEWNESS is a measure of the extent to which the distribution of the data 'leans' to one side or the other.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,classifying shape of distributions,,
figure,"A distribution that has a left skew is one in which the left TAIL of the plot is longer. In other words, on a histogram the majority of the distribution is located to the right of the mean. This distribution is also said to be left-skewed. When a distribution is left-skewed, the value of the MEAN is less than that of the MEDIAN, and thus the MEAN is located further to the left of the distribution. In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents the mean.",NA,NA,NA,NA,mod1_leftskew.R,new,NA,classifying shape of distributions,,
figure,"On the other hand, a distribution that has a right skew is one in which the right tail is longer, such that the majority of the data falls to the left of the mean, when viewed on the histogram. This distribution is said to be right-skewed. When a distribution is right-skewed, the value of the MEAN is greater than that of the MEDIAN, and thus the MEAN is located further to the right of the distribution. In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents the mean.",NA,NA,NA,NA,mod1_rightskew.R,new,NA,classifying shape of distributions,,
figure,"A plot that has no skew is one in which the tails on both sides of the mean balance out, and is referred to as symmetric. When a distribution is symmetric, the MEAN and MEDIAN are approximately equal in value. In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents the mean. The green line is the only one visible since the mean and median are so close to the same value.",NA,NA,NA,NA,mod1_symmetric.R,new,NA,classifying shape of distributions,,
