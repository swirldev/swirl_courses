  Version: 2.2.0

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming
    language.

- Class: text
  Output: If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related
    to R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of resources
    (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup).
    Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type
    5 + 7 and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 5 + 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='5 + 7')
  Hint: Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming
    language and often the reason we use a programming language as opposed to a calculator
    is to automate some process or avoid unnecessary repetition.

- Class: text
  Output: In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation.
    Instead of retyping 5 + 7 every time we need it, we can just create a new variable
    that stores the result.

- Class: text
  Output: 'The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment
    operator, which is just a ''less than'' symbol followed by a ''minus'' sign. It
    looks like this: <-'

- Class: text
  Output: Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value
    on the right side of the arrow to the variable name on the left side of the arrow.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <-
    5 + 7. This can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.
  CorrectAnswer: x <- 5 + 7
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('x <- 5 + 7', 'x <- 7 + 5')
  Hint: Type x <- 5 + 7. It's important to include a single space on each side of
    the assignment operator, but do NOT put a space between the `<` and the `-` that
    form the arrow.

- Class: text
  Output: You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you
    use the assignment operator, R assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately,
    but rather that you intend to use the result for something else later on.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try
    it now.
  CorrectAnswer: x
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x')
  Hint: Type x and press Enter. This will automatically print the value of x.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.
  CorrectAnswer: y <- x - 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='y <- x - 3')
  Hint: Type y <- x - 3 and press Enter. Whether you use x - 3 or x-3 is personal
    preference, but it's good habit to include a space on either side of the assignment
    operator.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the value of y? Type y to find out.
  CorrectAnswer: 'y'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='y')
  Hint: Type y and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Now, let's create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object
    that contains data is called a data structure and numeric vectors are the simplest
    type of data structure in R. In fact, even a single number is considered a vector
    of length one.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands
    for 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To create a vector containing the numbers 1.1,
    9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the result in a variable
    called z.
  CorrectAnswer: z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)')
  Hint: Inputting z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14) will assign the vector (1.1, 9, 3.14) to a
    new variable called z. Including single spaces after the commas in the vector
    is not required, but helps make your code less cluttered and more readable.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's
    built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want more information
    on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses that normally follow a function
    name. Give it a try.
  CorrectAnswer: ?c
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?c')
  Hint: Type ?c and press Enter. This will bring up the help file for the c() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating
    the values in the output.
  CorrectAnswer: z
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='z')
  Hint: Type z and press Enter to view its contents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains
    z, 555, then z again in that order. Don't assign this vector to a new variable,
    so that we can just see the result immediately.
  CorrectAnswer: c(z, 555, z)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(z, 555, z)')
  Hint: Type c(z, 555, z). Don't create a new variable. We just want to view the result.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following
    to see what happens: z * 2 + 100.'
  CorrectAnswer: z * 2 + 100
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='z * 2 + 100')
  Hint: Enter z * 2 + 100, without assigning the result to a variable. The `*` symbol
    is used for multiplication and shares a key with the number 8 on many keyboards.

- Class: text
  Output: First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added
    100 to each element to get the result you see above.

- Class: text
  Output: Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where x^2
    means 'x squared'). To take the square root, use the sqrt() function and to take
    the absolute value, use the abs() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.
  CorrectAnswer: my_sqrt <- sqrt(z - 1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_sqrt <- sqrt(z - 1)')
  Hint: Assign the result of sqrt(z - 1) to a variable called my_sqrt.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it
    contains?
  CorrectAnswer: a vector of length 3
  AnswerChoices: a vector of length 3; a single number (i.e a vector of length 1);
    a vector of length 0 (i.e. an empty vector)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='a vector of length 3')
  Hint: 'Think about how R handled the other ''vectorized'' operations: element-by-element.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print the contents of my_sqrt.
  CorrectAnswer: my_sqrt
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_sqrt')
  Hint: Just type my_sqrt and press Enter to view its value.

- Class: text
  Output: As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then
    took the square root of each element. This leaves you with a vector of the same
    length as the original vector z.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided
    by my_sqrt.
  CorrectAnswer: my_div <- z / my_sqrt
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_div <- z / my_sqrt')
  Hint: Enter my_div <- z / my_sqrt. The spaces on either side of the `/` sign are not
    required, but can often improve readability by making code appear less cluttered.
    In the end, it's personal preference.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which statement do you think is true?
  CorrectAnswer: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided
    by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...
  AnswerChoices: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided
    by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...; my_div is a single number (i.e a
    vector of length 1); my_div is undefined
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The first element of my_div is equal to the first
    element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...')
  Hint: Think about how R handled the other 'vectorized' operations like `+` and `*`.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.
  CorrectAnswer: my_div
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_div')
  Hint: Type my_div and press Enter to see its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified
    arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) element-by-element. If the vectors
    are of different lengths, R 'recycles' the shorter vector until it is the same
    length as the longer vector.

- Class: text
  Output: When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length
    3, but technically 2 and 100 are each vectors of length 1.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Behind the scenes, R is ''recycling'' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and
    the 100 to make a vector of 100s. In other words, when you ask R to compute z
    * 2 + 100, what it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, 100, 100).'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try adding
    c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the result in a new variable.
  CorrectAnswer: c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)')
  Hint: Enter c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10) in the console to see how R adds two vectors
    of different length. Don't assign the result to a variable.

- Class: text
  Output: If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length
    of the longer vector, R will still apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw
    a warning to let you know something fishy might be going on.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.
  CorrectAnswer: c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)')
  Hint: Type c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) to see how R handles adding two vectors,
    when the shorter vector's length does not divide evenly into the longer vector's
    length. Don't worry about assigning the result to a variable.

- Class: text
  Output: Before concluding this lesson, I'd like to show you a couple of time-saving tricks.

- Class: text
  Output: Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let's pretend that you made a mistake and that you meant to add 1000 instead of 100. You could either re-type the expression, or...

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you get to this command (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow doesn't work for you, just type the corrected command.
  CorrectAnswer: z * 2 + 1000
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='z * 2 + 1000')
  Hint: If your environment does not support the up arrow feature, then just type the corrected command to move on.

- Class: text
  Output: Finally, let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable that you created earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named it my_div or myDiv. You could try both and see what works, or...

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list of variables that you've created that begin with 'my'. This is called auto-completion and can be quite handy when you have many variables in your workspace. Give it a try. (If auto-completion doesn't work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)
  CorrectAnswer: my_div
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_div')
  Hint: If your programming environment doesn't support auto-completion, just type my_div and hit Enter to move on.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Would you like to inform someone about your successful completion of this lesson?
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  AnswerTests: notify()
  Hint: NULL
